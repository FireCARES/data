# FireCARES-related terminology

#### "Hazard"

Set by the NFPA as structure's risk of fire based occupancy and structure type, in FireCARES this is captured at a per parcel record level.

- **High-Hazard Occupancies** – High-rise buildings, hospitals, schools, nursing homes, explosive plants, refineries, public assembly structures, and other high life hazard or large fire potential occupancies.

- **Medium-Hazard Occupancies** – Apartments, offices, mercantile and industrial occupancies that may require extensive use of fire fighting forces.

- **Low-Hazard Occupancies** – One-, two- or three-family dwellings and scattered small business and industrial occupancies.

#### "Risk"

Likelihood of an event happening within a specific area using [NFORS]() historical event data as a benchmark for comparison.  

#### "Parcel"

Single tract of land w/ one or more structures, based on ownership.

#### “Similar fire departments”

In FireCARES, fire departments with similar size, binned on protected population size and [region](http://www.sfm.illinois.gov/Portals/0/docs/JFSI/regionalfactsheet.pdf).

#### "Jurisdiction"

Area of responsibility for a single fire department.

#### “Census tract”

Segments geographic areas by population count, target population size of a single census tract is 5000 people.  Departments that handle the most calls in a census tract is the “owner” of that census tract in FireCARES.

#### "Safe grades"

N-ranking (quartile) of fire department performance against fire risk, fire spread and death & injuries as compared with similar fire departments.  Split into 4 buckets, but categorized as "good", "fair" or "poor" based on comparison to similar departments.  National Assessment of performance score based on the fire spread/death and injury risk takes into account all departments with the same "low", "medium", etc risk levels for those dimensions.

#### “Performance score”

Comparison with similar fire departments (uses building fires from NFORS database), count # of building fires w/ fire spread binned and modeled for residential structures in terms of time to spread.
